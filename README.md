# One Page Application Demostrating Knowledge of the DOM

This one page application contains a slide show of gifs that have been manually stored instead of pulled from an external database. The following requirments were met:

Cache at least one element using selectElementById.

Cache at least one element using querySelector or querySelectorAll. (querySelector was used.)

Use the parent-child-sibling relationship to navigate between elements at least once
(firstChild, lastChild, parentNode, nextElementSibling, etc.) (nextElementSibling was used.)

Iterate over a collection of elements to accomplish some task. (GIFs were iterated through)

Create at least one element using createElement. 

Use appendChild and/or prepend to add new elements to the DOM. 

Use the DocumentFragment interface or HTML templating with the cloneNode method to create templated content (previous and next buttons were created using DocumentFragment).

Modify the HTML or text content of at least one element in response to user
interaction using innerHTML, innerText, or textContent.


Modify the style and/or CSS classes of an element in response to user interactions
using the style or classList properties. (The background colors of buttons change in response to user interaction)

Modify at least one attribute of an element in response to user interaction. (The placeholder attribute for both name and email inputs change in response to user interaction.)

Register at least two different event listeners and create the associated event
handler functions. 

Use at least two Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods.

Include at least one form and/or input with HTML attribute validation.

Include at least one form and/or input with DOM event-based validation. (At submission of name and email, both are checked against already provided patterens and also there is a function that checks that username includes both first and last names.)
